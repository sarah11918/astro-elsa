### Taking advantage of Tropical Storm Elsa to learn Astro!

After spending time laying the groundwork to rescue www.summersidechoir.ca from a well-intentioned but fatally-flawed Jekyll instance (rewriting from scratch with GatsbyJS - project at https://github.com/sarah11918/scctake2), I got bored with the fine-tuning stage and wanted to explore what I want to do with my OWN website, www.rainsberger.ca

This is my Astro(.build) playground as I figure out what's what, deployed at https://astro-elsa.netlify.app/ , and try to do a bunch of things (using JavaScript and React) for the sake of doing them.

As always, Coded on a Chromebook, in a browser and Created with CodeSandbox
